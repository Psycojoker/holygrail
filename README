Toudoudone
==========

Toudoudone aims to be a base library to interact with a todo database. It provides a
simple interface allowing you to interact with your todo in several ways.
This means that you can create and use whatever client you like and even use multiple
interfaces (ie: cli, mail, web application etc).
Yes, this is geeky and I like it.

In its current state, Toudoudone is usable but not really interesting. You can
only create todo with a description and mark it as completed. If you want to
start playing with it, the code is documented.
"Release early, release often" as someone said.

In it's current state Toudoudone is usable but not really interesting. You can
only create todo with a description and check it as completed. If you want to
already play with it, I try to keep the code documented.
"Release early, release often" they said.

I hope to provide much more cool features, a cli interface and sample interface
in the future. The structure will be inspired a lot by Tracks (getontracks.org)
with projects and contexts.

Installation
------------
Create a config.py file and add this variable:

DATABASE_ACCESS = "value according to http://www.sqlobject.org/SQLObject.html#declaring-a-connection"

Sample (don't forget to create that username/database etc ...):
DATABASE_ACCESS = "mysql://username:password@localhost/database"

If you have questions, bugs etc ... ping me on irc.freenode.net, pseudo Bram,
or mail me at cortex@worlddomination.be
