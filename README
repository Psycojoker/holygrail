HolyGrail
==========

HolyGrail aims to be a base library to interact with a todo (missions)
database. It provides a simple interface allowing you to interact with your
todo in several ways. It's a GTD (getting things done) oriented approach.

This means that you can create and use whatever client you like (on the same
db) and even use multiple interfaces on the same database (ie: cli, mail, web
application etc).
Yes, this is nerdy and I like it.

My main inspiration is Tracks (getontracks.org). This database handle:
 - missions (todos)
 - quests (projects)
 - realms (contexts)
and all operations of them via one main class Grail.

I found the todo/project/context vocabulary boring and non motivating so I've
chose to use the medieval one.

If you like tracks main view, I have written a main_view method that recreate this behavior.

For the moment their isn't any released client but I'm working on a ncurse one
(I have also a really dirty cli client).

Installation
------------
(sudo) python setup.py install

Create a ~/.holygrailrc file and add:

[holygrail]
uri=value according to http://www.sqlobject.org/SQLObject.html#declaring-a-connection

For example:
uri=sqlite:/home/user/.holygrail.db
for sqlite

or
uri=mysql://username:password@localhost/database
for mysql (don't forget to create that username/database etc ...)

If you have questions, bugs etc ... ping me on irc.freenode.net, pseudo Bram,
or mail me at cortex@worlddomination.be
